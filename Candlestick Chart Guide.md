     - **Top of the Body (Red Candle)**: Opening price.
     - **Bottom of the Body (Red Candle)**: Closing price.
   - **Wicks (Shadows)**: The thin lines above and below the body. They represent the highest and lowest prices during the time period.
     - **Upper Wick**: Highest price.
     - **Lower Wick**: Lowest price.

3. **Moving Average (SMA 10)**: The blue line represents the Simple Moving Average (SMA) over 10 periods (days in this case). This is calculated by averaging the closing prices of the asset over the last 10 periods and helps to smooth out price data to identify trends.
